## Description

The features of this project is to generate random images using Dall-e (beta version) from OpenAI's API and see what output it can generate based on user's input. 

## Purpose of this App

To further develop my React and JavaScript abilities as well as entertaining my curiosity.


### Key Features
* Users enter in anything they want and  can be as creative as they can and several images will populate. It can also be downloaded
* Users can hit the 'Surprise me' button if they would like to have an idea of what to put
* Users can upload any image from their local storage and Dall-e can generate variations of that image. The image sizes must be 256x256 or 512x512

### Technology Used

* React
* Node.js
* Express
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Multer
* fs



### What challenges did I face, what did I learn?
* A lot of step by step documentation that appears straightforward but can lead to confusion from OpenAI's website. I had trouble determining whether I needed to install openai for React for example.
* My first time using Multer so I encountered several errors due to my lack of understanding at the beginning but after proper research I was able to get it running.
